/*Function "tableForAnEvent" accepts an large array of objects (journal) and an event (should be an from a pool of events in the array of objects) and populates a "table" array based on 2 conditions
//table can be visualized this: 00 01
//								10 11
//00 (table index 0) : event = false, squirrelness = false
//01 (table index 1) : event = false, squirrelness = true
//10 (table index 2) : event = true, squirrelness = false
//11 (table index 3) : event = true, squirrelness = true

//Variable (array of objects) that will be passed to the function. Each object has 2 properties i) "events" which is an array depicting the actiivties of person on the day ii) "squirrel" which is a boolean that states whether or not the person transformed into a squirrel on the day
